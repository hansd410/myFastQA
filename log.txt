Prince Lev Nikolaevich Myshkin ( Князь Лев Николаевич Мышкин ) is the protagonist of Fyodor Dostoyevsky ' s novel The Idiot . Dostoyevsky wanted to create a character that was ` ` entirely positive . . . with an absolutely beautiful nature ' ' , someone who was like Christ . According to Joseph Frank , the character of Prince Myshkin approaches ` ` the extremest incarnation of the Christian ideal of love that humanity can reach in its present form , but he is torn apart by the conflict between the contradictory imperatives of his apocalyptic aspirations and his earthly limitations . ' ' 
 
 Prince Myshkin has been in Switzerland for the last four years , at a sanatorium for treatment of his epilepsy . At age 26 , having recovered his health , and in possession of a legal document suggesting entitlement to a significant inheritance , he returns to Russia . In St . Petersburg , his purity and guilelessness lead many to the false conclusion that he is an ` ` idiot ' ' . In fact he possesses an incisive intellect , deep emotional intelligence , and a wisdom that surpasses all the other characters in the novel .

The North Atlantic Current ( also known as North Atlantic Drift and North Atlantic Sea Movement ) is a powerful warm ocean current that continues the Gulf Stream northeast . West of Continental Europe , it splits into two major branches . One branch goes southeast , later to become the Canary Current as it passes northwest Africa and turns southwest . The other major branch continues north along the coast of Northwestern Europe . It is thought to have a considerable warming influence on the climate , but there is a minority view . Other branches include the Irminger Current and the Norwegian Current . Driven by the global thermohaline circulation ( THC ) , the North Atlantic Current is part of the wind - driven Gulf Stream , which goes further east and north from the North American coast across the Atlantic and into the Arctic Ocean .

Gillespie Road is a road in Highbury , north London , running east - west along the north side of the Arsenal Stadium , previously home of Arsenal Football Club . Arsenal tube station was originally named Gillespie Road , before being given its current name in 1932 following pressure from the club . At the time of Arsenal ' s move to the nearby Emirates Stadium in July 2006 , an email was circulated by supporters of rival club Tottenham Hotspur inviting petitions to the Mayor of London , asking him to give the station back its original name [ http : / / www . telegraph . co . uk / sport / main . jhtml ? viewDETAILS & grid

It has land borders with Lebanon to the north , Syria to the northeast , Jordan on the east , the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west , respectively , and Egypt to the southwest . It contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area . Israel ' s financial center and technology hub is Tel Aviv . Jerusalem is the proclaimed capital , although Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized . The Jerusalem Law states that ` ` Jerusalem , complete and united , is the capital of Israel ' ' and the city serves as the seat of the government , home to the President ' s residence , government offices , supreme court , and parliament . United Nations Security Council Resolution 478 ( 20 August 1980 ; 14 – 0 , U . S . abstaining ) declared the Jerusalem Law ` ` null and void ' ' and called on member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem . The United Nations and all member nations refuse to accept the Jerusalem Law ( see ) and maintain their embassies in other cities such as Tel Aviv , Ramat Gan , and Herzliya ( see the [ https : / / www . cia . gov / library / publications / the - world - factbook / geos / is . html CIA Factbook ] and [ http : / / www . un . org / Depts / Cartographic / map / profile / israel . pdf Map of Israel ] ) . The U . S . Congress subsequently adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act , which said that the U . S . embassy should be relocated to Jerusalem and that it should be recognized as the capital of Israel . However , the US Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the provisions of the act ` ` invade exclusive presidential authorities in the field of foreign affairs and are unconstitutional ' ' . Since passage of the act , all Presidents serving in office have determined that moving forward
